# JBST Expo

The JBST Expo is a showcase of amazing and inspiring implementations of the [Jamedo's Bootstrap Start Theme (JBST)](https://github.com/bassjobsen/jamedo-bootstrap-start-theme) WordPress theme framework, curated by [@bassjobsen](https://github.com/bassjobsen).

Browse the entries at [JBST Expo](http://expo.jbst.eu/)!



## Submissions

We do not accept all submissions. We only select high quality, beautiful, and comprehensive examples of building with JBST. Sites appearing too similar to JBST's default settings or [Boilerplate-JBST-Child-Theme](https://github.com/bassjobsen/Boilerplate-JBST-Child-Theme) generally will not be accepted. Submissions with inappropriate content will also not be accepted.

To submit a site, [open an issue](https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-expo/pulls/new) or [a pull request](https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-expo/issues/new). (Any new pull request should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide)).



## Additional resources

Beyond the official gallery, there are a handful of services documenting examples of JBST in the wild.
